# JS based Blog Site

The current issue right now is that when one is trying to view individual post pages, the page continues to load until the server is restarted.

To add a post: 

localhost:3000/compose

Create a post with a title and a body then publish it. You will be redirected to the homepage.

Try accessing your post @ localhost:3000/posts/theNameOfYourPost. Make sure to use '-' as spaces. 

Please comment below about your experience. 

Thank you.
